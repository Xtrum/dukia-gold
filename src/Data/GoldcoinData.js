The value of the Britannia gold coin is marked in British Pound and is legal tender in Great Britain. Since 1987, the coin is available in units of 1/10 ounce, 1/2 ounce and 1 ounce. \n \n Since 2013, the Gold Britannia has a fineness of 999,9. Before that, it was 916,7 — equaling 22 Karat. Until 1989, an alloy of copper (1/12) was used, which gave the coin a reddish colour. Afterwards, copper and silver were used in the same ratio. Since 1997, the Britannia is also available in silver. \n \n The front image of the Britannia gold coin is the Roman goddess and personification of the country “Britannia“ as a standing figure with helmet, shield and trident. The motif remained unchanged up to the Millennium. Since 2001, the motif of the Gold Britannia changes in years with uneven numbers and remains the same in years with even numbers. The portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, which is updated irregularly according to the current appearance of the regent, is pictured on the reverse. \n \n The gold coin is VAT free if the secure storage option with Brink’s is opted for.

      description: "The one-ounce (1 oz) Gold Krugerrand Coin is a South African gold coin which has been minted at Rand Refinery in Germiston close to Johannesburg since 1967. It is the most widespread bullion coin in gold. It is available in units of 1 ounce, 1/2 ounce, 1/4 ounce and 1/10 ounce. \n The fineness of the Krugerrand gold coin is at 916.7. The alloy with copper gives the coin a reddish colour and enhances the scratch resistance. \n The Gold Krugerrand is named after the South African president Paul Kruger (1882-1902) and the South African currency 'Rand'.  The front shows Paul Kruger’s portrait. On the back is a springbock-antelope, the heraldic animal of the Republic of South Africa. Despite the Gold Krugerrand not having any currency indicator it is considered legal tender. The value is determined according to the price of gold on every business day. The London Gold fixing functions as value indicator. \n \n During the first three years of mint, the batch of Krugerrand gold coins was under 50,000 ounces per year. After that, production increased four times and reached its peak of up to 6 million ounces during the oil crisis. In 1986, the apartheid’s imposition of sanctions led to a sharp decline in production which lasted until the abolition of embargo on imports in 1999. \n \n The gold coin is VAT free if the secure storage option with Brink’s is opted for. Storage fee is free for the first 12 months of storage. Your specific numbered gold bar will be fully allocated to you in your name and segregated within the vault. \n All shipping costs is inclusive of handling, protective packaging, insurance, and VAT.
